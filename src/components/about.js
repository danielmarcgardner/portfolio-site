        Prior to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, I spent seven years as an
        event manager in the Sports and Non-Profit industries. Some of my
        accomplishments as an event manager include: creating hospitality events
        for the 2011 Orange Bowl; managing and marketing all home sporting
        events for the University of San Francisco Athletic Department; and
        managing four major fundraising galas that raised over $3.2 million
        while implementing new mobile bidding technology.

        In January 2017 I started Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program
        with a dream to learn how to code and continue my passion for building
        things. In June 2017 I completed the program and was hired by Galvanize
        to be a full time Web Developer Resident. Since leaving Galvanize, I
        worked for a design firm Redshift Digital as a Frontend Developer, 
        as the Frontend Engineer at Revere.ai, and as a Full Stack Engineer at Trim.
