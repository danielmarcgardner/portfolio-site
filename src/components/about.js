      <p>
        I am passionate about building and creating, a drive that has shaped both my career and personal interests.
        {' '}Currently, I serve as the Associate Director of Engineering at OneMain Financial, where I lead the Trim Engineering team.
        {' '}My journey with Trim began as a Full Stack Engineer during its early days as a startup,
        {' '}and I transitioned into a leadership role after its acquisition in April 2021, managing and expanding the team to drive innovative solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Before transitioning into tech, I spent seven years as an event manager in the sports and nonprofit industries.
        {' '}Highlights of my event management career include orchestrating hospitality events for the 2011 Orange Bowl,
        {' '}managing and marketing all home sporting events for the University of San Francisco Athletic Department,
        {' '}and organizing four major fundraising galas that collectively raised over $3.2 million while integrating cutting-edge mobile bidding technology.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In January 2017, I pursued a dream to learn how to code by enrolling in Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program.
        {' '}After graduating in June 2017, I joined Galvanize as a Web Developer Resident, supporting students and honing my skills.
        {' '}Since then, I’ve held roles as a Frontend Developer at Redshift Digital, Frontend Engineer at Revere.ai, and Full Stack Engineer at Trim,
        {' '}where I’ve continuously evolved as a builder, problem-solver, and leader.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Whether it's creating software, managing engineering teams, or orchestrating high-stakes events,
        {' '}I thrive on transforming ideas into reality and empowering teams to reach their full potential.
