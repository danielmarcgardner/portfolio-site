      <p>
        I love building things and it has always been a passion of mine.
        I am a Full Stack Web Developer working currently as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.asktrim.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trim</a>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Prior to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer, I spent seven years as an event manager in the Sports and Non-Profit industries.
        Some of my accomplishments as an event manager include: creating hospitality events for the 2011 Orange Bowl;
        managing and marketing all home sporting events for the University of San Francisco Athletic Department;
        and managing four major fundraising galas that raised over $3.2 million while implementing new mobile bidding technology.

      <p>In January 2017 I started <a href="https://www.galvanize.com/web-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galvanize's Web Development Immersive program</a> with a dream to learn how to code and continue my passion for building things.
      In June 2017 I completed the program and was hired by Galvanize to be a full time Web Developer Resident.
      Since leaving Galvanize, I worked for a design firm <a href="https://redshiftdigital.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redshift Digital</a> as a Frontend Developer, part time for <a href="https://www.home-slice.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HomeSlice</a> as a Full Stack Engineer, and as the Frontend Engineer at <a href="https://revere.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revere.ai</a>.</p>
